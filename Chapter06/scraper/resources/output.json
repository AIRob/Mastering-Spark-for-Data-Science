When he was brought to the Center for Wildlife last Monday, his blood tests all came back normal.\"He was seemingly a very healthy animal,\" said Sonja Ahlberg, the center's medical clinic coordinator. \"Except he was clearly very sick.\"By Wednesday afternoon, he was “in pretty severe respiratory distress.” He could barely",

    "body": "on a few occasion when meticulous people express interest in why the Lagos State Governor , Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode , prefer to keep he middle name in the background , 1.0 tend to wonder if the tradition of add a middle name to 1.0 's identity or use initial PAST_REF 1.0 assume public office be a constitutional requirement or simply to boost 1.0 's social status\nbut before 1.0 could register Dapo as the governor 's middle name on inquisitive mind , many Lagosians themselves be already unanimous in they agreement that the governor have PRESENT_REF acquire a acceptable middle name -- Compassion -- by virtue of he people-oriented style of governance\nthey be correct\nto address the man at the helm of affair in Lagos State as Mr. Compassionate be indeed state the obvious , because Ambode 's administration in P7M have bring verve to the art of selfless service , by neatly coating he policy and direct intervention with what he term ` compassionate governance .\nit be not difficult to see why Lagosians have acknowledge that a man with a kind mien be PRESENT_REF steer the ship of this state at a time that the rest of the country say belt-tightening be the only option for survival in these very austere time\nthis Ambode 's trait become unmistakable from he 1.0 PXD in office\nand it would not matter to this epe-born , cerebral administrator whether he be personally attend to a accident victim whose car skid off the road during rush-hour traffic or give succour to a family in distress\nwhich woman will ever forget the joy on the face and in the life of Mrs. Ruth Uche , who be give a home and financial assistance by the governor after she be abandon by she husband for give birth to a 3.0 set of twin\nor who will not rejoice with Mr. Godwin Odia , who in P1D lose 4.0 child in a landslide disaster in the Magodo area of Lagos in XXXX-11 but who have PRESENT_REF be rehabilitate with n5m donation from the state governor\nnor , would the story of Pa.\nAlfred Ilenre escape Lagosians\nthe P76Y activist and chairman of the XXXX-06-12 Coalition of democratic formation have sustain a disorder in he left lung as a result of a fatal accident he have in Ghana in 1998 during the National Democratic Coalition -lrb- NADECO -rrb- crisis\nGovernor Ambode have notice the man 's frail condition at a ceremony in Lagos to commemorate THIS P1Y INTERSECT XXXX-06-12 and have subsequently direct that the man be give the best of medical attention\nit be a grateful Pa.\nilenre that return to the Lagos House in Ikeja , OFFSET PXM to testify to Ambode 's care nature and large heart -- Compassion\nyet , private individual be not the sole beneficiary of Ambode 's generosity\nthe governor and people of Borno , Yobe and Adamawa state be not likely to forget he in a hurry , for he kind donation of n50m to each of the state\nit be the governor 's way of show compassion to those 3.0 state mostly affect by act of insurgency and terrorism affect the north-eastern part of the country\nif Ambode have do well invest in the security of life and property in Lagos , a city-state that be witness a large daily influx of people from state affect by insurgency and harsh economic reality , he donation in XXXX-10 to those state also confirm the governor 's firm understanding of the leadership role that be expect of Lagos as Nigeria 's most prosperous state and Africa 's 6.0 largest economy\nall these evoke the import of the governor 's inaugural speech on 2015-05-29 when he state without equivocation that `` compassionate governance '' would be the hallmark of he administration\nto the civil servant and other public service worker in Lagos , who consider Ambode they biggest icon , be the 1.0 career civil servant to be elect a governor in this cosmopolitan and multi-cultural state , the compassionate content in the PRESENT_REF administration ring true indeed\nprompt payment of salary , through which most other state governor be assess , be the least of Ambode 's worry\nin fact , the buzz around the civil service these PXD be that the alert from payment of salary come in such a unbelievable good time that some people have to pretend that the alert be not on they phone so that they do not start spend before THIS P1M end\nnot only have the governor streamlined the annual disbursement of ` XXXX-12-25 rice ' to worker , he have actually favour a 25.0 per $ tax-free bonus , which have since be pay with the XXXX-12 salary to every worker , over the sharing of rice and other edible item that often leave junior worker short-change\nhowever , in Ambode 's compassionate world , man shall not live by bread alone\nas part of he effort to improve the welfare of worker , the dynamic governor have extend the Accident Insurance Policy for its workforce to cover accident record outside work PTXH\nin PAST_REF , the policy cover only accident record during work PTXH\nit cover every employee and every form of accident during the active service PXY of the concerned staff regardless of the period of occurrence\nfor sure , there be a sense in give worker the necessary incentive to go the extra mile as employee of the state throughout they PXY in service if the state wish to get the best out of they\nthis indeed be a welcome addition to the provision of the Lagos State Pension Reform Law 2007 which stipulate that the life insurance policy will be make mandatory for employee through the appropriate insurance company to pay compensation that be P3Y basic emolument of the concerned staff , comprise of basic salary , housing allowance and transport allowance as benefit for the relative in case of a employee 's death while in service\nyet , the Ambode administration have start the review of the payment of additional 20.0 per cent of accruable rights to the family of deceased worker , outside the basic entitlement under the State Pension Law\nthis proposal sure speak volume about a government that be sympathetic to the plight of family of deceased personnel and the need to provide they with succor\nread Ambode 's lip , the direction of he administration be also to seek the harmonisation of the career progression of officer in the Lagos State Public Service , which suggest the need for a review of the career progression of officer in the local Government Service , parastatal organisation and other government-owned agency with a view to harmonise they with what obtain in the mainstream civil service\nfor a governor who spend P27Y in the public service , a good chunk of which be record in the local government sector as treasurer before rise to be auditor-general for local government , nothing short of this type of fairness , equity , global best practice and the fact that no 1.0 should be leave behind be expect of he\nthe need to bring relief to he worker , both serve and retire , accord to this compassionate governor , therefore , be very paramount ; which be why he have expend more than n11bn on payment of pension arrears alone since he assume office\nin addition , retirement seminar be organise for officer about to retire so as to assist they in they retirement while the Post Service Directorate in the Office of Head of Service be efficient in provide information and assistance to worker and retiree on they welfare and other need\nAyorindeis the Lagos State Commissioner for Information and",
